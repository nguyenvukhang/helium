# Helium

Helium is a tiny MacOS menubar app that brings you precision mode on
Wacom Tablet **without the [translucent overlay](#ps)**.

Instead, you can configure a bounded overlay to appear, which will
only appear when the pen is near to the tablet.

When triggered, the precision mode will be centered at your cursor's
current location.

If your cursor is too close to the edge, it will be offset from the
centre only just enough to fit on the screen again.

This is unlike Wacom's precision mode default behaviour, which takes a
somewhat weighted offset from the center of the screen.

Helium's correction allows for much easier corner access. If your
cursor was near the corner to start with, you probably want to go all
the way to the edges.

## Requirements

Your Wacom tablet needs to already be working before installing this.
Helium requires Wacom's drivers to work.

## Building

Open `Helium.xcodeproj` with XCode, build an Archive and drag that
into your `/Applications` folder.

##### P.S.

Here's how Wacom's implementation of precision mode looks like:
